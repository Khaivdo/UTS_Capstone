# Distance Estimation

Originally model was developed by [harshilpatel312](https://github.com/harshilpatel312/KITTI-distance-estimation) which could estimate the distance of an object to the camera in a single frame. In this project, I modified the code so we could detect objects and distance simultaneously, given the input is a video.
